## Instructions

Change the paths of textures and shaders in main.cpp because I have put the <abs_path> where you have to replace with absolute path of directory when you clone the repo.

For convinience I have made run.sh.

### How to run ?
Run the game using :
```
./run.sh
cd build
./app
```

The game starts !!!

All images are in the src/images folder.

Press spacebar to move up.

Thanks.
