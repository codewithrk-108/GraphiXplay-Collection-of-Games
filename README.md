## Mini-Trailer using Blender

Youtube Link : [Mini Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Or09Vg_D80)

The animated video was made on the theme of the Pathan Movie.
The robbers are rushing away over the bridge and through the road in a yellow truck, and the Hero Pathan enters in a red dashing car with an awesome entry. 
The animations and the objects in the scene were made from Blender, while for the Pathan's car, it was imported as ready-made graphics model.
The video can be viewed on youtube.
