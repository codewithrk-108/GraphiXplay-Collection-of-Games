Video : 


## Mini-Trailer using Blender
The animated video was made on the theme of the Pathan Movie.
The robbers are rushing away over the bridge and through the road in a yellow truck, and the Hero Pathan enters in a red dashing car with an awesome entry. 
The animations and the objects in the scene were made from Blender, while for the Pathan's car, it was imported as ready-made graphics model.
The video can be viewed below and also on youtube.
